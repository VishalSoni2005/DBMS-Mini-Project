# Design and implement a database management system for a gym to efficiently manage member information, membership plans, attendance records, instructor details, and equipment inventory. The system should provide functionalities for member registration, membership management, tracking attendance, managing instructors and equipment, and generating reports through a user-friendly interface

Manage Members:

1-> Register new gym members, including details such as name, contact information, address, date of birth, gender, membership start date, and selected membership plan.

2-> Update existing member information.
Deactivate or terminate member accounts.

3-> Search for members by name or membership ID.

Manage Membership Plans:

a> Define different membership plans with details such as plan name, duration (e.g., monthly, yearly), and fees.
b> Add, update, and delete membership plans.

Track Attendance:

i> Record member check-in and check-out times at the gym.
   This could be a simplified manual entry

## Manage Instructors

Add new instructors to the system, including details such as name, specialization (e.g., yoga, Zumba, strength training), contact information, and working hours.
Update existing instructor information.

### Manage Equipment

Maintain an inventory of gym equipment, including details such as equipment name, description, purchase date, and condition (e.g., working, needs maintenance).
Add, update, and remove equipment from the inventory.

### Reporting and Queries (at least two of the following)

1. Generate a list of all active members.
2. Show the membership plan details for a specific member.
3. Display the attendance records for a given date or time period.
4. List all instructors and their specializations.
5. Provide a list of equipment that needs maintenance.
6. Show the number of members who joined within a specific month.
